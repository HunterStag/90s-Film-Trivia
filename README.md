I am 90s film fanatic. I also really love Trivia games. I grew up watching Jeopardy with my parents every night and got heavily into Trivia Games like Quizlet. I hope to continue working on this project and perhaps make more nostalgic trivia games in the future!


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://hunterstag.github.io/


## Game Logic

```
1. A question will be displayed to the player related to some aspect of 90s films.
2. Four answers choices will be displayed.
3. The player can click on the one answer that they believe to be correct.
4. If the answer choice is correct, the player gets 1 point.
5. If the answer choice is incorrect, the player gets 0 points.
6. After the trivia game is over, a final score will be displayed indicating how many correct answers a player got. 


```


- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline: Randomize the questions (Thanks Leon!)
- Add more css. Change the font of the H1 to make it more readable (this has proven to be harder than I thought) Make a more aesthetically pleasing scoresheet. 
- Make a leaderboard
